                            <li>Second, do you have any allergies? When you go visit cats do you notice yourself sneezing or having watery eyes? It may be a good idea to get an allergy test before getting a cat.</li>
                            <li>Lastly, do you have a well ventilated area to put the litter box? Or are you willing to train them to use the toilet like those cats online!</li>
